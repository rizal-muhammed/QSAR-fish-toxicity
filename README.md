## Description
Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models are computational models used to predict the biological activity or properties of chemical compounds based on their molecular structure. The fundamental principle behind QSAR modeling is that the structure of a molecule influences its biological activity or other properties. By analyzing the structural features of a dataset of molecules with known activities or properties, QSAR models can be developed to predict the activity or property of new, untested molecules. In this project, we aim to develop a quantitative QSAR model to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish PimPimephaels promelas (fathead minnow)
